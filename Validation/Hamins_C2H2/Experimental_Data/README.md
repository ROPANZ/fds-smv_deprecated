##Hamins Acetylene Burner

####Overview

A series of measurements were made on a variety of gaseous and liquid pool fires including the distribution of radiative heat flux emitted to the surroundings.  This document briefly describes the acetylene results. Analogous results for pool fires burning other fuels are described elsewhere.  The experiments are described in detail in Refs. [1-5]. A full report describing the data is in preparation and will be available soon (see Hamins, Energetics of Small and Moderate-Scale Gaseous Pool Fires, NIST TN, 2016, in preparation.)

Experiments were conducted varying the acetylene mass flux for fires burning in a quiescent environment in two circular burners (0.10 m and 0.38 m diameters) for idealized heat release rates varying from 1 kW to 50 kW.  Measurements in the 16 associated files represent the time-averaged distributions of radiative heat flux emitted to the surroundings. The radiative flux results were used to determine the radiative fraction, a key global parameter characterizing the fraction of energy lost to the surroundings. A number of other measurements and calculations were made, including heat loss to the burner and the sensible enthalpy fraction transported by the fire plume via convection. 

####Experimental Description

The experimental apparatus and procedure is reported in detail in [1,3]. Steadily burning gaseous acetylene fires were established in a quiescent environment (after several minutes of burning). 

A series of fires was studied for a range of pool fire parameters including the mass burning rate, the pool diameter, and fuel type. Measurements were conducted using methane, propane, natural gas, and acetylene in burners varying from 0.1 m to 1 m in diameter, producing flames from 0.1 to 2 m tall with total heat release rates from 0.4 to 200 kW.  A series of measurements were made characterizing the time averaged mass burning rate and the distributions of radiative heat flux emitted from the fires.  These data were then used to determine the radiative fraction, a key global parameter characterizing a fire. Radiative heat flux distribution measurements were made for about 16 acetylene fire conditions. Additional fires scenarios were considered to better understand the partition of the transport of energy from the fire. 

Experiments were conducted varying the fuel mass flux for fires burning in a quiescent environment in two circular burners (0.10 m and 0.35 m diameter) for idealized heat release rates varying about two orders of magnitude from order 1 kW to 100 kW.  Measurements were made of the time-averaged distributions of radiative heat flux emitted to the surroundings. These results were used to determine the radiative fraction, a parameter characterizing the fraction of energy lost to the surroundings. A number of other measurements were made, including heat loss to the burner, and for some tests, the sensible enthalpy fraction transported by the fire plume via convection.  Results from six analagous methane experiments have been previously used to test the efficacy of FDS to predict the radiative flux distribution from small to moderate-sized methane fires. [1,6]. Here, data for 16 acetylene fires are presented.  

Steady state burning conditions were established before measurements were initiated. A warm-up period of 3 min to 5 min was required for steady conditions. The experimental apparatus and method are described in more detail in Refs. [7-15], respectively. The rate of gaseous fuel delivery was controlled using calibrated rotometers. The mass flow of the gaseous fuel was determined from multiple measurements using a dry test meter and a stopwatch to measure the volume per unit time of fuel delivered to the burner and a thermocouple measurement of the ambient temperature. The combined expanded measurement uncertainty for the fuel mass flow was 4 %.  All uncertainties reported here are for a coverage factor of two, which is equal to two times the standard deviation [16].  

The smallest gaseous burner had a 0.10 m diameter (and approximately a 0.0015 m wall thickness) that was filled with a 0.03 m layer of sand below its rim; it had 3 mm (outer diameter) copper water-cooling lines embedded as a series of coils in the form of a loosely wound spiral located 1 cm below the surface of the sand and around the outside of the burner. Sand is a good insulator; thus the surface of the sand was at elevated temperatures as measured by three thermocouples at the burner surface (r = 0 cm, 2.5 cm, and 4.5 cm). The measured temperature varied radially across the surface with temperatures reaching steady values of a few hundred degrees after burner warm-up. The area-weighted steady state average temperature varied from 200 &deg;C to 450 &deg;C.  

The middle-sized burner was made of porous sintered-bronze and was water cooled with the surface having a physical dimension of 0.38 m diameter, yet the effective diameter of the burning area was observed to be consistently smaller as noted by a flame-free outer (1.5 cm) annular section on the burner surface.  It was as if the porous burner had a higher pressure drop near the burner edge.  The effective diameter was measured as 0.353 m.  The surface temperature of the burner was taken as approximately equal to the burner water cooling temperature at the burner outlet.  

The largest burner tested in this series of experiments was used for methane and propane but not acetylene. It had a 1.00 m inner diameter, was 0.075 m deep, and had a wall thickness of approximately 0.0015 m. The burner was filled with a layer of course gravel and then a 0.03 m layer of sand below its rim. The bottom of the burner was not water-cooled. Sand is a good insulator, so the surface temperature of the sand was at elevated temperatures as measured by three thermocouples at the burner surface (0 m, 0.25 m, and 0.45 m from the burner center). 

For the two smaller water-cooled burners (0.10 m and 0. 35 m), the steady-state average temperature difference (dTw) between the burner water cooling inlet and outlet along with the water flow was used to determine the total heat feedback to the burner (Qb).

Calibrated water-cooled radiometers were used to measure the time-averaged radiative heat flux distribution along a cylindrical control surface surrounding the fire.  The gauges had a time response of about 2 s. The view angle of the heat flux gauges was measured to be approximately 150 degrees, somewhat smaller than a full hemisphere. The gauges were calibrated using a secondary standard in a well-characterized radiometer facility [14, 15].  About 10 water-cooled (2.5 cm diameter) total heat flux transducers were positioned along perpendicular axes aligned with the burner.  The first row of radiometers was positioned on a vertical axes located some distance away from the fire. The radiometers were oriented horizontally facing the fire situated on a radii away from the burner center. The second row was oriented upwards positioned along the radius on the plane aligned with the burner surface. The radiative flux typically drops off very quickly in the radial direction, whereas in the vertical direction, the flux peaks at a vertical location equal to approximately 50 % of the characteristic flame height and then drops to small values above the visible flame tip. The measured signal was time-averaged for about one min. The uncertainty (with a coverage factor of two) in the radiative flux measurement was 16 %, which took into account gauge calibration and signal (and background) variability.

The energy per unit time emitted by the fire was determined by integrating the measured spatial distributions of radiant flux about a cylindrical surface surrounding the fire.  The radiated power emitted by the fire was determined by integrating the measured spatial distributions of radiant flux.  The radiative heat loss fraction (Xr) was determined by dividing the measured radiant power by the idealized measured fire heat release rate. The relative expanded uncertainty in the value of Xr (with a coverage factor of two) was estimated as 17 %  considering uncertainty in the local radiative heat flux and the mass flow rate. 

For the 0.35 m acetylene fires, the convected enthalpy fraction (Xc) was determined by measuring the flow and temperature near the exhaust duct inlet. This allowed estimation of the combustion efficiency, Xa.   A thermocouple array was placed about 2 m above the exhaust duct entrance, reducing radiation from the fire.  The total mass flow was determined about 20 m downstream using a bidirectional probe and thermocouple. Measurements were made after the velocity and temperature were steady, which usually occurred several minutes after a change in the fuel flow rate.  The temperature and velocity measurements were acquired at a sampling rate of 0.2 Hz and averaged for about 2 mins.  The sensible enthalpy of the plume was determined from the heat carried by the combustion products through the exhaust duct.

The heat capacity and density of the exhaust flow was computed as a function of temperature using the ideal gas law. The gas was assumed to be pure air, which is a fair approximation as the exhaust gases are composed mainly of air (with only highly dilute amounts of combustion products such as CO, CO2 and H2O at values of less than about a few percent by volume). With mass conserved in the duct, mass flow measurements were made far downstream from the duct entrance using thermocouples and bidirectional probes.  The combined relative expanded uncertainty in was estimated as 10 % based on a propagation of error analysis and repeat measurements [7]. The measurement and uncertainty analysis assumed that heat losses from the duct to the surroundings were small relative to transported enthalpy.  The expanded measurement uncertainty for and was 10 % and 11 %, respectively.  From this information, the expanded uncertainty of was estimated as 21 %.  For fires in which was not measured,  was calculated.  Assuming a value of unity for, the expanded uncertainty of was estimated as 18 %.  A propagation of error analysis [17] showed that the expanded uncertainty in the calculated value of L was related to the expanded uncertainty in multiplied by the factor 0.4(1+1.02 D/L), which on average was 4 %.  The full paper provides a more complete uncertainty analysis (A. Hamins, Energetics of Small and Moderate-Scale Gaseous Pool Fires, NIST TN, 2016, in preparation).

For each of the fires, a complementary file provides the measured distribution of radiative heat flux in the downward (along the radial axis on the burner surface, q"(r)) and the sideways directions (along the vertical axis, q"(z)).  Typical radiative heat flux measurements include both the flux downwards as a function of radial distance from the burner center and the flux sideways as a function of vertical location above the plane defined by the burner surface for locations 0.69 m from the burner axis. Sometimes the radial flux is larger than the horizontal flux, sometimes not, depending on the fire size and shape. The acetylene fire produces copious amounts of soot. In all cases, however, the integrated flux in the horizontal direction is larger than that in the downward direction.  

The temperature of the burner surface was non-uniform for the fires in the 0.10 m sand burner. The temperature varied from 220 &deg;C to 370 &deg;C, depending on the conditions and the radial location. The measured cooling water temperature at the burner inlet and outlet for the 0.35 m diameter burner was between 30 &deg;C and 70 &deg;C. Under steady state conditions, the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet provides a basis for determination of heat transfer to the burner.  Results for the 0.1 m and 0.35 m acetylene fires are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively (and in the full paper as Tables A2.6 and A2.7, respectively).

The measurement of Qb and Xb involved measurement of the water cooling mass flow and its temperature difference through the burner. The values of Xb are relatively large (>0.2) for small mass flux (100 g/(m2.s) to 200 g/(m2.s)) and rapidly fall-off as the mass flux increases (see Table 1).  

The relative expanded uncertainty of the measurement of Xb was 6 % on average, whereas the model uncertainty was about 18 % based on uncertainty in its input parameters.  About 1/3 of the data points are in agreement within the expanded combined uncertainty, whereas the rest of the data are not, although some points are close to agreement. The worst agreement was for the acetylene fires in the 0.35 m burner. The reason for this is unclear, but the general trend of decreasing with mass flux holds for these conditions as well as the other cases.  These results confirm the importance of "blowing" on convective heat transfer to the horizontal burner surface. This phenomenon may have significance for burning solids in a horizontal configuration such as thermoplastics and wood, particularly in the early stages of a fire.  

In summary, a series of measurements was conducted to characterize global fire properties on a variety of gaseous pool fires. The measurements included the distribution of radiative heat flux emitted to the surroundings as a function of fuel mass flux for different burners sizes and fuel types.  This information was used to calculate the fraction of energy emitted as radiation.  Heat transfer to the burner, and sensible enthalpy transfer to the surroundings by convection were also measured.  The measured total fractional heat feedback to the burner was compared to its calculated value.  For all fuels and burner sizes considered here, the radiative fraction increased and the enthalpy loss to the burner decreased as a function of fuel mass flux.  Future work is needed to directly measure Xa and the yields of smoke and carbon monoxide for all of these fires.
